Her other accusations (e.g., using human shields, resource misuse) are presented as symptoms of this larger corruption problem.",

The speaker explicitly states, 'they're going to try to twist this whole narrative around about Brandon Zapata,' indicating an intention to counter a potential misrepresentation. By connecting Zapata's specific situation (a mental health crisis met without appropriate specialized intervention) to the broader discussion of excessive force and police conduct, the speaker aims to present a tangible example that illustrates the systemic problems and lack of appropriate response mechanisms they had just critiqued. Option (B) best captures this integration of a specific case as an illustration of broader systemic issues.",
