Jonathan clarifies that the product team gives 'pushback... about the visuals we, the marketing team, publish on social media' because they 'doesn't feel like it's like part of the brand correctly, one with the brand'. This indicates a core tension between marketing's desire for experimentation and vibrancy, and product's focus on brand consistency and alignment.",

This aligns with the CPO's stated preference for 'slower work where all outputs are tested with users before implementation,' which would naturally delay visual experimentation. Concurrently, the marketing team's copy is altered by non-skilled copywriters in the product team, leading to typos. The CMO 'wants to work fast' due to 'sales not going well' and 'leaves meetings earlier,' implying less time for thorough review or collaboration, which could exacerbate both the rushed visuals and uncoordinated copy changes. The conflicting speeds and priorities between the 'fast' CMO and 'slower' CPO, who 'hardly ever talk to each other,' directly contribute to the teams' inability to align on visual direction and ensure content quality through proper collaboration.",

Grace Hutchison explicitly mentions that 'colonization is not something of our past, but is something that continues and persists today,' and the museum scene visually and audibly reinforces the impact of stolen heritage.
