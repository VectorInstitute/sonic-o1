This involved making close observations of astronomy, cosmology, and seasons, understanding their relationships and influence on human life, which was crucial for agrarian societies. This directly supports option (C) as the method by which they approached health as a natural science.",

This highlights a probabilistic view. The Huangdi Neijing, as described in chapters 1-4, focuses on balancing Yin and Yang (1:23, 2:45), adjusting lifestyle based on seasons (2:20-2:22), and aligning oneself with natural laws (2:28-2:32) to promote longevity (2:14-2:15, 2:40-2:41) and prevent illness (3:17-3:19). This approach of adapting to changing patterns and balancing internal and external factors aligns with navigating probable outcomes rather than predicting a single definite one, directly paralleling the probabilistic nature discussed for the Yijing and quantum mechanics.",
