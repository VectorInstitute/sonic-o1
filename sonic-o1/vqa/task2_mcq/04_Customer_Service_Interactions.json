This depersonalizes the refusal, making it less confrontational than the direct and aggressive tone used in the second attempt ('You have 30 seconds to get your stuff before I call security to drag you out'). While offering safe transport is also a good strategy (B), it comes *after* the initial refusal and request to leave, and the question specifically asks about the *verbal refusal strategy* itself.
