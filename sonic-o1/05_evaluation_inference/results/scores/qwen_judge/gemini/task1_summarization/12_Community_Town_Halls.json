However, it omits key details such as the specific student groupings (cohort model with 15 students), the role of ELL and intervention staff, the extended family survey deadline, and the legislative support for vaccinations. It also simplifies some aspects, like the 1:15 ratio being part of staffing shifts."

Overall, it maintains semantic alignment with the correct answer."
