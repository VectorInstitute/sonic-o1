The customer's initial enthusiasm fades as they realize the product isn't uniquely beneficial compared to cheaper alternatives. The salesperson attempts to pivot by focusing on the customer's role as a buyer of expensive items, suggesting that the pen's quality justifies its cost. However, this line of reasoning seems to miss the customer's underlying need for a pen that fits their personal preferences or requirements, such as smooth writing or compatibility with specific uses. The customer's frustration is evident in their questioning, highlighting a disconnect between the sales pitch and the actual customer need. This moment underscores the importance of tailoring a product's value to a customer's specific problem, rather than relying on general attributes. The emotional tension between the salesperson's focus on price and the customer's emphasis on personal fit is central to this scene, illustrating a common challenge in sales where understanding the deeper need is crucial for a successful sale.",
