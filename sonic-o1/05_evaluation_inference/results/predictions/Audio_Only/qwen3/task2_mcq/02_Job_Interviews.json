The man then challenges her by asking why he should buy it when other pens are similar. Her follow-up question, 'Why do you need this pen?', shifts the focus from the product itself to the customer's underlying requirement. The man explicitly endorses this shift, stating, 'Look for understanding the need of the customer. You are there to give a solution. You are not there just to carry the product to the customer.'

This is all about vocal variety and projection.\n\nFor face-to-face interviews, he advises to 'be warmed up,' to be 'animated,' and to use eye contact. He specifically says, 'I often talk about the importance of eye contact in a face-to-face interview' and to 'involve all panelists with eye contact.' He also mentions 'physical gestures' as part of being animated.\n\nTherefore, the advice to use vocal variety for telephone interviews and eye contact/physical gestures for face-to-face interviews is the most accurate summary. Option A is correct.\n\nOption B is incorrect because he does not say to 'keep a cheat sheet' for telephone interviews; he says to have 'examples of your competencies' but not to be seen reading. He does not mention a cheat sheet for face-to-face.\n\nOption C is incorrect because 'avoid reading' is not the primary advice for telephone interviews; the primary advice is to use vocal variety. For face-to-face, he does mention involving all panelists, but not specifically with 'eye contact' as the method.\n\nOption D is incorrect because 'stand up to project voice' is for telephone interviews, not face-to-face.
