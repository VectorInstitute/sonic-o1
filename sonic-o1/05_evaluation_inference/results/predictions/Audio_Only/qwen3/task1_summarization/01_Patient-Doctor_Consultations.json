The speaker outlines a structured approach, starting with the 'WIPE' protocol (Wash hands, Introduce self, Patient details, Expose if necessary, Reposition) to ensure safety and rapport. He details the core components of a history: the presenting complaint, systems review, past medical history, drug history, family history, and social history. The speaker emphasizes the importance of open-ended questions, particularly for the presenting complaint, and introduces useful acronyms like 'SOCRATES' for pain assessment and 'ICE' for understanding a patient's ideas, concerns, and expectations. He stresses that while a structured method is helpful, flexibility and patient-centered communication are crucial. The video also touches on practical aspects like checking for allergies, screening for mood, and assessing activities of daily living, concluding with a reminder that this is a personal compilation of helpful tips, not a definitive guide.",

The interviewee, a representative from the ABIM Foundation, explains that the 'Trust Initiative' was launched in 2018 to bring together key stakeholders to address this issue. He posits that the decline in trust is due to medicine becoming more distant, institutional, and less personal, with an over-reliance on scientific facts at the expense of patient relationships. The conversation then shifts to the future, where technology acts as an intermediary. The guest argues that technology should not replace human connection but should be leveraged as a tool to build and support relationships, citing an example of a hospital where patients could video-call their families and doctors from different locations.

He then highlights a critical disparity: while large academic medical centers have seen a 90% increase in consultations since 2018, smaller hospitals have seen only a 10-20% increase, leading to growing inequities. To bridge this gap, Dr. Tolchin's team has established a 'Center for Clinical Ethics' that acts as a 'hub and spoke' model, providing support to six hospitals in the system. The center offers education (including a fellowship and HEC certification), research and quality improvement initiatives, and organizational ethics consultations.

The speaker, Dr. Benjamin Tolchin, conveys a palpable sense of urgency and professional responsibility as he details the widening gap in access to ethics consultation services between large teaching hospitals and smaller community centers. His tone is both scholarly and impassioned, suggesting a deep personal and institutional commitment to rectifying this imbalance. The discussion of the 'hub and spoke' model reveals a collaborative spirit, aiming not just to provide support but to build capacity and empower smaller hospitals with education and resources. The conversation shifts to the real-world application of these principles during the COVID-19 Omicron surge, where the speaker describes a protocol that had to ethically withdraw life-sustaining resources from some patients. This segment is delivered with a somber gravity, acknowledging the profound sadness and moral distress inherent in such decisions. The Q&A that follows is marked by a respectful, inquisitive dynamic, with the audience members demonstrating genuine engagement and care for the ethical and practical challenges of implementing these difficult protocols, particularly concerning patient autonomy and fairness.",

The session begins with an overview of the current landscape, highlighting that while virtual consultations have been essential during the pandemic, there is a consensus that they should complement, not replace, face-to-face care. The speakers, including a consultant clinical psychologist from NHS Western Isles, a neurologist from NHS Fife, and a neuropsychologist from NHS Grampian, present their practical experiences and case studies. They emphasize that the success of these consultations hinges on the individual patient's needs, the condition being assessed, and the availability of technology. A key theme is that the process is iterative; they are continuously learning and adapting. The speakers address the importance of a hybrid model, acknowledging that while many patients have benefited from the convenience and reduced travel, others still require the in-person assessment. They also discuss practical considerations such as ensuring patients have the right devices and a stable internet connection, and the need for clinicians to be trained in both the technical and interpersonal aspects of remote care. The session concludes with a Q&A, where the speakers share that they are actively seeking feedback to improve their services.",

Dr. Dow explains that Near Me serves as a crucial 'stepping stone' for students transitioning from practicing with patient partners to real-life consultations. She highlights the authenticity of using real patients and the absence of scripts. Dr. McKeown emphasizes the solution's value in addressing a 'workforce crisis' and a shortage of teaching capacity by enabling larger groups of students to learn from a single session.
