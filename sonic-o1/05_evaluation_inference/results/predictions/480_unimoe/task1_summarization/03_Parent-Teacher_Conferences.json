The teacher then shifts to the main topic, asking about the son's recent behavior and inquiring about home life, specifically financial issues. Mr. Anil responds, explaining the family's struggles and the difficulty in focusing on the son's studies. The teacher emphasizes the importance of parental involvement in education and inquires about the son's future plans, suggesting attending extra classes. The conversation concludes with Mr. Anil expressing gratitude for the teacher's help.
