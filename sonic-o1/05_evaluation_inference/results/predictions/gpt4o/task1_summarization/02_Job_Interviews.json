The woman begins by extolling the pen's virtues, such as its smooth writing and fantastic quality. However, the trainer interrupts her, emphasizing that these attributes are not unique and can be found in other pens. He guides her towards understanding the importance of identifying the customer's specific needs before making a sales pitch. The trainer highlights that a salesperson should focus on providing a solution to the customer's problem rather than merely pushing a product. He suggests that understanding whether the customer needs the pen for its color, writing thickness, or to match a specific outfit is crucial. The video underscores that sales are about meeting the customer's requirements and that asking the right questions is essential to uncovering those needs.",
