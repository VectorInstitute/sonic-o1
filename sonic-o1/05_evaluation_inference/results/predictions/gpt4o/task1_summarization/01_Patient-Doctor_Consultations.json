The opening speaker, who seems to be experiencing technical difficulties, sets a tone of perseverance and adaptability that reflects the challenges faced by many during virtual interactions. The main theme is the balance between embracing new technology and addressing patient concerns, such as privacy and accessibility. Participants express a collective acknowledgment of the benefits of virtual consultations, particularly in terms of accessibility for remote communities, while also highlighting the importance of patient-centered care. The emotional undertone is one of cautious optimism; professionals are eager to innovate but remain mindful of the nuanced needs of patients, such as emotional safety and the ability to provide comprehensive care. This is particularly evident in discussions about cognitive assessments and tele-swallowing, where the need for careful patient selection and robust training is emphasized. The presenters display a commitment to collaboration and continuous improvement, aiming to ensure that technological advancements do not compromise the quality of care or the therapeutic relationship. There is a palpable sense of community and shared purpose, as participants invite feedback and express a desire to learn from each other\u2019s experiences to refine their practices.",

They explain how Near Me has been integrated as a teaching tool for third-year medical students, allowing them to transition from simulated consultations to real patient interactions. This tool enables students to conduct live video consultations with real patients, which are streamed into classrooms, offering a more authentic and engaging learning experience. Dr. Mckeown emphasizes the challenge of increasing student numbers amid workforce shortages and how Near Me provides a solution by enhancing teaching capacity without the need for additional physical spaces or tutors. The students have responded positively, describing the experience as transformational, feeling more prepared for independent practice. Dr. Dow highlights the advantages of using real, unscripted consultations compared to traditional models, noting the enhanced authenticity and practical value. The video concludes with the speakers expressing satisfaction with the platform's ease of use and effectiveness in teaching, encouraging viewers to explore Near Me for educational purposes.",
