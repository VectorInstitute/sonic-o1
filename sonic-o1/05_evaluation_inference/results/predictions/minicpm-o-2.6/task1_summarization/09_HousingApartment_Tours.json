        "summary_detailed": "The video begins with a person standing on a balcony overlooking the sea, wearing a white shirt and green shorts. The background features a scenic view of boats in the water under a clear blue sky. A wooden deck area is shown next to lush greenery, followed by an interior room featuring large windows showcasing views of palm trees and distant hills. Another outdoor scene highlights more lounge chairs set against stone walls and green foliage.\n\nThe focus shifts indoors to a cozy bedroom setting with beige walls, a bed adorned with multiple pillows, a bench at its foot, and sheer curtains partially drawn over a window. Large framed artwork adds color to the space. An adjacent living or dining area follows, characterized by modern decor elements like a table, lamps, and plants, all bathed in natural light streaming through expansive glass doors leading outside. The serene ambiance continues as the camera captures various angles of this indoor-outdoor environment.\n\nThe narrative transitions back outdoors along a stone pathway lined with colorful umbrellas and potted plants, eventually reaching another patio furnished for relaxation. Inside, the same person reappears speaking while gesturing towards different areas of the house. This segment concludes with close-up shots of furniture details such as cushions, vases, and decorative items, emphasizing the aesthetic appeal of each piece.\n\nThe final part shows additional rooms within the home, including one with bunk beds decorated with patterned bedding and others featuring minimalist designs with neutral tones. A kitchenette equipped with appliances and neatly arranged spaces suggests functionality alongside style. Throughout these scenes, consistent lighting enhances the warm atmosphere created by sunlight filtering through open spaces. The overall presentation conveys a luxurious yet comfortable lifestyle centered around beautiful seaside vistas and well-designed interiors.",
