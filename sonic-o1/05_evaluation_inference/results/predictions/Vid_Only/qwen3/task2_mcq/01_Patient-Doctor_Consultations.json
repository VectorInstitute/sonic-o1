This indicates that the cause of swelling is not simple and requires specific diagnosis. The speaker's emphasis on referring to a 'Lymphoedema service' strongly suggests that the treatment for such chronic swelling is compression therapy, not diuretics (water tablets). Diuretics are typically a first-line treatment for acute swelling caused by fluid overload, like in heart failure, but are not the primary treatment for chronic conditions like lymphoedema, which is often the cause of long-standing leg swelling.",
