He explains the 'undergoing principle' of the trick: if the person being thrown at doesn't move, they don't get hurt. This implies the safety of the trick relies on the performer's adherence to a specific, non-negotiable rule. The lawyer then states, 'There was a 300 cm action. And you know where he fell? At the 300 cm.' This indicates the fatal injury was caused by the performer moving at the critical moment, thus compromising the safety principle of the act. This is a classic argument that the performer's own actions, not the inherent danger of the act, were the cause of the accident.",
