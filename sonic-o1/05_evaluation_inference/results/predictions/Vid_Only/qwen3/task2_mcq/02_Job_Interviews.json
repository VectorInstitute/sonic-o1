The woman initially describes a feature ('It's a Super Pen Sir' at 0:07) and a benefit ('Smoothly and it's fantastic' at 0:12). The man's instruction to 'WAIT TILL ME SPECIFICALLY' (0:09) and his praise for her final question, 'Why do you need this pen?' (0:19), indicates that he values understanding the customer's specific needs and situation. This allows the salesperson to provide a tailored solution rather than a generic description of a product's features. The man reinforces this by stating, 'So look whether it is for thin writing or for thick writing' (0:41-0:42), which is a direct example of providing a solution based on a need.",
