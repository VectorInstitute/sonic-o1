The man challenges this by asking why one should buy *this* pen over others with the same features. The woman then shifts to a need-based approach by asking, 'Why do you need this pen?'. The man explicitly praises her for asking this 'right question' and explains the principle: 'Look for understanding the need of the customer. You are there to give a solution, you are not there just to carry the product to the customer.'

She then concludes that this means the teacher is 'dependent on the students' feedback and the result' and will 'keep on doing that.' This demonstrates that her 'trick question' is designed to reveal whether a teacher's primary motivation is internal and derived from the positive outcomes of their work with students, which is the essence of intrinsic motivation.",

If they are then faced with a teacher who has a 'poker face,' they will feel a sense of dissatisfaction that they can't articulate, but still feel. This directly supports option C. Option A is a plausible inference but not explicitly stated. Option B is not mentioned in the video. Option D is the opposite of the speaker's point.
