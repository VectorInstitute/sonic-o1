For the communication strategy, the speaker then introduces the 'presenting complaint' and explains that 'a really great way of getting this information from the patient is by asking them an open-ended question and just letting them talk for as long as they need to.'

The doctor's empathetic response is, 'I understand what you mean, you are really anxious about your unintentional weight loss.' This shows an understanding of the patient's underlying feeling (anxiety).
