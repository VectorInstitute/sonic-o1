The subsequent story of the French author Mopsa and the knife-throwing trick is used to draw a parallel, where the performer's safety was also contingent on the principle of not moving. The speaker suggests that the trickster's death was likely due to a lapse in this principle, which supports the idea that the Jamura's death was a result of him moving, thus nullifying the safety principle.",
