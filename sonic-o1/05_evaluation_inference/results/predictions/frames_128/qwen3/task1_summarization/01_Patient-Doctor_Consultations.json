He outlines a structured approach to taking a patient's history, starting with pre-history preparations like washing hands and introducing oneself. He details the core components of a medical history: presenting complaint, history of the presenting complaint, systems review, past medical history, drug history, family history, and social history. For each section, he offers specific strategies and example questions. He discusses the importance of active listening, using open-ended questions like 'Could you please tell me what brought you in today?' to let the patient lead. He also introduces clinical acronyms such as SOCRATES for pain, MENSTRUAL for obstetric history, and ICE for exploring patient ideas and concerns. He emphasizes that while a structured outline is helpful, flexibility is key, and the history should be adapted to the individual patient. He concludes by encouraging viewers to share their own tips in the comments.",

He welcomes his guest, Richard J. Baron, MD, MCPs, President & CEO of the American Board of Internal Medicine (ABIM). Dr. Baron explains that the decline in trust is a major problem that could prevent patients from accessing the benefits of modern medicine. He attributes this decline to medicine becoming more institutional and distant from patients. A key part of the conversation revolves around the role of technology, with Dr. Baron arguing that technology should be a tool to build and support relationships, not replace them. He uses the example of a new hospital in Dallas where patients can use TV screens to connect with family and doctors remotely, illustrating how technology can enhance, rather than hinder, trust. The video concludes with a discussion on the future of healthcare, emphasizing that trust is fundamental to the relationship between patients and providers.",

The core of the presentation is the hub-and-spokes model, which uses a central ethics team at Yale New Haven Health (the 'hub') to provide support, education, and policy guidance to affiliated hospitals (the 'spokes'). A key feature of this model is the 'Escalation of Care Protocol,' a policy designed to guide clinicians in changing a patient's code status from full resuscitation to DNR or DNI when an intervention is deemed extremely unlikely to be beneficial.

The presentation, hosted by Mark Bisset, features several speakers who share their experiences and research. Callum Duncan, a consultant neurologist, details the transition to virtual consultations during the pandemic, discussing the benefits for both patients and clinicians, including improved access and patient satisfaction. The presentation also covers the development and implementation of remote swallowing assessments (TeleSwallow) in Argyll and Bute, including training for staff, risk assessments, and the evaluation of patient and staff outcomes. The speakers emphasize the importance of maintaining the therapeutic relationship, ensuring patient safety, and acknowledging the limitations of technology, while advocating for a hybrid model of care that combines face-to-face and remote consultations.",

They discuss their use of the NHS 'Near Me' video consultation platform to enhance medical student education. The session begins with an introduction, followed by a split-screen view of the speakers and their backgrounds. Dr. Dow explains that 'Near Me' serves as a 'stepping stone' for students, allowing them to practice with real patients and clinicians in a simulated yet authentic environment. She highlights the benefits over traditional scripted scenarios or patient partners, emphasizing the authenticity and unpredictability of real consultations. Dr. McKeown then discusses the significant advantage to teaching capacity, noting that the platform allows them to host larger groups of students in a single session, overcoming physical limitations in GP practices. Both speakers share positive student feedback, with one describing the experience as 'transformational' from being 'on training wheels' to feeling ready to 'cycle independently'. The video concludes with information on where to find more details about 'Near Me'.",
