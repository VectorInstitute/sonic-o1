This is supported by the work of the University of Chicago team, who found that SOFA overestimated mortality in Black patients compared to White patients in a pre-COVID ICU cohort. The critical ethical issue is the potential for SOFA to unfairly disadvantage non-Hispanic Black patients, even if their actual prognosis is similar, leading to inequitable resource allocation. Other options are either incorrect or not directly supported by the video's content. Option A is incorrect because the video does not suggest preferential treatment for non-Hispanic White patients; the concern is about non-Hispanic Black patients being disadvantaged. Option C is incorrect because SOFA's use in triage could worsen equity, not improve it. Option D is incorrect because SOFA's accuracy was not arbitrary, but it still had limitations.
