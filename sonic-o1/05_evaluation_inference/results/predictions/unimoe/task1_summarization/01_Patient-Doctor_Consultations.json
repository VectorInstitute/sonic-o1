        "summary_detailed": "Naser Khan, a final-year medical student at King's College London, provides a comprehensive guide on how to take a patient history, emphasizing the importance of structure, patient safety, and patient-centered communication. He breaks down the process into key sections: the presenting complaint, history of presenting complaint, systems review, past medical history, and social history. He introduces the 'ICE' method (Ideas, Concerns, Expectations) for structuring the conversation and explains the 'Socrates' pain history tool (Sight, Onset, Character, Radiation, Associated Symptoms, Timing, Exacerbating/Relieving Factors, Severity/Scale). Naser emphasizes the importance of verbal confirmation, active listening, and adapting the approach based on the patient's context. He also discusses the 'DOPT' (Duration, Onset, Progression, Timing) tool for chest pain history and the 'GMC' acronym for gynecological history. The video includes visual aids like flowcharts and diagrams to illustrate the concepts, and Naser concludes with a summary of the importance of patient history in clinical practice.",
