        "summary_detailed": "The video is a sales training session where a man in a suit demonstrates how to effectively sell a pen to a woman in a white outfit. The man starts by asking the woman to sell the pen, and she enthusiastically agrees, calling it a fantastic pen. He then asks her to tell him specifically why she should buy it, to which she responds that it is fantastic and smooth. The man interrupts her to ask why she needs the pen, to which she says, 'because other pens write smoothly too.' He then tells her to wait and understand the need before asking why she needs the pen, leading to a discussion about understanding customer needs. The woman asks why he needs the pen, and he explains that it is a costly pen. The video emphasizes the importance of understanding the customer's need and not just trying to sell the product. The man concludes by saying that the woman has a good job and that she should understand the need before trying to sell the product. The video ends with a call to action for the woman to understand the need and not just try to sell the product.",
