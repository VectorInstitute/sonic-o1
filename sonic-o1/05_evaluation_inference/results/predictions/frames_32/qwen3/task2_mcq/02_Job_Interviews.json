The man immediately challenges this by asking for a more specific reason to buy it. The woman then reframes her approach by asking the customer, 'Why do you need this pen?' This shifts the focus from the product itself to the customer's underlying need. The man explicitly states, 'Look for understanding the need of the customer. You are there to give a solution. You are not there just to carry the product to the customer.' This directly supports option B.

For telephone interviews, he emphasizes using 'pitch, tone, and speed, and silence' to maintain the panel's interest (01:08-01:23). For face-to-face interviews, he stresses the importance of 'eye contact, involve entire panel' (02:30) and being 'warmed up' (02:23) to make a strong first impression. Option A correctly pairs these distinct strategies. Option B is incorrect because while a cheat sheet is suggested for telephone interviews, 'arriving warmed up' is advice for face-to-face interviews, not for telephone. Option C is incorrect because 'avoid reading' is advice for telephone interviews, but 'involving all panelists' is part of the face-to-face advice, not a general 'avoid reading' strategy for the latter. Option D is incorrect because while standing is advised for telephone interviews, punctuality is a universal rule, not a specific difference in how to maintain engagement.",

She then describes the ideal answer, saying, 'When a person tells me, you know what, you're not going to like what I say, but I like it when they at the end of the lesson, they come and they hug me and I feel fulfilled because I know I did something well and I do it for myself.' This response, which she calls 'amazing,' indicates that the teacher is driven by the personal satisfaction of student interaction and feeling fulfilled. This directly points to intrinsic motivation and deriving fulfillment from the act of teaching and student appreciation.",

This demonstrates a deliberate strategy to hire from a new, geographically dispersed pool of teachers who share a cultural connection with the target audience.
