Senator Cruz poses a hypothetical question about gender identity, suggesting that changing one's gender could impact Article 3 standing, and inquires if the same principle applies to other protected characteristics. Judge Jackson responds by explaining that she would assess standing similarly to other legal issues, emphasizing the importance of listening to arguments, considering precedents, and constitutional principles. The exchange highlights the complexity of interpreting standing in the context of evolving identities and protected classes. The participants' body language suggests a respectful and professional interaction, with Cruz appearing engaged and Jackson demonstrating confidence in her responses. The underlying concern is the potential for fluidity in identity and the need for legal clarity in addressing such changes.",
