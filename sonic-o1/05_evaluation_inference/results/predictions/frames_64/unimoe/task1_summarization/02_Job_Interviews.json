The salesperson repeatedly asks the customer to specify why she should buy the pen, emphasizing the importance of understanding the customer's needs and solutions. The customer, however, keeps deflecting the question by pointing out the smooth writing quality of other pens, but the salesperson insists on the unique selling point of the pen. The video includes text overlays that highlight key phrases and messages, such as 'FANTASTIC PEN,' 'UNDERSTANDING THE NEED,' and 'NOT JUST TO TRY TO SELL.' The salesperson's strategy is to build a relationship with the customer and understand her requirements before making a sale, highlighting the importance of customer-centric sales techniques. The video serves as a training tool for salespeople to emphasize the importance of understanding customer needs and providing a tailored solution rather than just focusing on the product itself.",
