The other options are contradicted by the video; for example, option A is false as no alibi was presented, and option B is incorrect because the defense did not use the COVID diagnosis as a mitigating factor, which was a neutral fact of the trial.",

She then justified the father's behavior by saying, 'my dad has to punish me when I do things wrong,' which reframed the abuse as 'necessary discipline.' This response would create a profound conflict for the victim: it invalidates his own experience of pain and trauma while simultaneously reinforcing the abuser's power and justification. He had already expressed that he loved his father ('Yes, very') and that he was scared. His mother's denial and minimization would have intensified his distress and confusion, making him feel like his own perception of reality was wrong, thus undermining his agency and sense of safety.",
