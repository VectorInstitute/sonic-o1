Second, on the Cigna website, the speaker highlights the 'International Evacuation & Crisis Assistance Plus' as an additional benefit that costs $225.39 per month, which is $2,704.68 annually. Combining these two, the total annual cost is approximately $13,877, which is very close to the $13,800 mentioned in option A. However, the speaker explicitly states a preference for Global Rescue's evacuation service over Cigna's own, implying that the Cigna plan is the base medical coverage and the evacuation service would be obtained separately. The video then shows that Global Rescue's individual annual membership costs $375. Therefore, the most logical and intended combination is the Cigna medical plan ($11,172) plus the Global Rescue evacuation plan ($375), resulting in a total of $11,547, which is approximately $11,500. The rationale for choosing this combination is directly stated by the speaker: Global Rescue's service is 'specialized and well-regarded' and is preferred over the Cigna add-on, even though Cigna offers it.
