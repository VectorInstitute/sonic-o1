You are not there just to carry the product to the customer.' He reinforces this by saying, 'So it's the solution that you have to sell. The need, understand the need...'.

This demonstrates that the question is designed to uncover whether a teacher's motivation is derived from the personal fulfillment and positive feedback they receive from students, rather than just from a professional or objective standpoint.
