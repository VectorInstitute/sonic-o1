While Veszpr\u00e9m mounts a comeback in the latter half of the clip, narrowing the score to 23-21, they never equalize or overtake Flensburg.

When the blue team's goalkeeper makes a save (e.g., at 0:09 and 0:15), he immediately throws the ball into the unguarded net. This indicates that the white team made the tactical decision to substitute their goalkeeper for an additional offensive player (likely to maintain 6 attackers while serving a suspension or to create a numerical advantage), leaving their goal vulnerable to a full-court counter-attack upon a turnover.",
