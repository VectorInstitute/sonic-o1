One teacher mentions making 'a lot of enemies' because colleagues prefer to reinforce a 'victim-hood scenario' rather than teach global history correctly.

A third example describes an English teacher being criticized by colleagues for facilitating 'critical discussions' on race regarding the book 'Of Mice and Men,' instead of just following the standard guidance.
