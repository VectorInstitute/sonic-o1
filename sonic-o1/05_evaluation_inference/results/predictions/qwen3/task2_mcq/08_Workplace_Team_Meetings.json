He states, 'I think like finding a healthy balance between all of these will allow you to sustain your productivity and sustain the joy that software development brings you for a much longer amount of time.' This directly connects the holistic approach to personal health (reading, walking, physical activity) with the sustained ability to be productive and enjoy one's career, which is the essence of long-term professional growth.",
