Both of these orientations are driven by the experience of being a minority within a 'homogenous' workforce, as stated by the speaker and shown on the 'Teaching Scotland's Future' slide.

        "rationale": "David's announcement clearly outlines two distinct purposes for these activities. First, he asks attendees to 'fill in a feedback form' to 'share your thoughts on the session today,' which directly corresponds to collecting session evaluations. Second, he encourages attendees to 'go back to the welcome page... you'll find a link to Willow, where you will be able to meet... some of the speakers from various sessions and chat to the other people attending the event,' which is a direct reference to enabling further networking opportunities. These two points perfectly align with option (B). The other options are incorrect because the feedback form is not for resolving Q&As (C), there is no indication it's a mandatory requirement (D), and there is ample evidence to support the answer (E is false).",
