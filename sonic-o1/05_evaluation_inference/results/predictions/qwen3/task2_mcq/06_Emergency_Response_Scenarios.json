The slow infusion rate suggests that the initial goal is not to rapidly replace massive blood loss or to administer a high-dose antibiotic bolus, but to ensure the patient has a stable access point for potential future critical care.

The woman's denial of the safe word and the officers' insistence on its use, combined with their statement of being there for 'your protection,' strongly support this being a situation of domestic distress.",
