After the blue team scores to make the score 30-26, the white team (in white jerseys) is shown in possession of the ball near their own goal. The white team's goalkeeper, wearing a red jersey, is already out of the goal and positioned near the sideline, indicating that he has been substituted. This is a common high-risk, high-reward strategy in handball where a team trailing by a goal in the final minutes sacrifices the goalkeeper to add an extra field player for an offensive push, effectively playing with 6 attackers against 5 defenders. This substitution created the 'empty net' situation that the blue team exploited for their quick counter-attack and goal.",
