By requiring a well-done patty, the restaurant makes the food harder to chew and digest, thereby increasing the difficulty of the challenge. While options B and C are plausible, the speaker's direct statement about 'easier' suggests the change was made to simplify the process for the kitchen, which aligns most directly with option A, as a denser, well-cooked patty is more challenging to consume quickly than a softer, rarer one.",
