The man correctly identifies this as insufficient because other products can do the same. He then praises her for asking the crucial question, 'Why do you need this pen?' This directly highlights the principle that a salesperson's role is to provide a solution to a customer's problem, not just to sell the product itself. The man reinforces this by stating, 'You are not there just to carry the product to the customer. So look for the solution why they want it,' which perfectly matches option B.",

The speaker also highlights the benefits of this strategy, noting that it satisfies the 'feeling of connection' for the diaspora and that their courses are 'much more affordable for them.'
