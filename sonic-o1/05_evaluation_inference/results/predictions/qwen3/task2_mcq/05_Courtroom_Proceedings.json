The speaker at 3:08 notes that a 'quick verdict does not look good for the defendant,' and the speaker at 3:14 adds that it 'means the jurors, all twelve of them... reached this verdict fairly quickly.'

He says, 'If you want the witness to be cited at Delhi, the way you have to go about is you must ensure that he agrees that he is not anywhere in the south of India. Go proceed further. Ensure that he says that he is nowhere in the western and the northern side of India.' This demonstrates the strategic purpose of controlling the narrative. He then directly links this to preparation, stating, 'That is how you will have to go about and to do that, you will have to prepare a well-drafted questionnaire beforehand.' This shows the questionnaire is a tool to ensure all relevant facts are elicited. He also warns that without preparation, two things can happen: 'One, you may forget to ask questions which are relevant. Two, you will fall into that trap many a times.' This directly supports option B, which states the advantage is to 'ensure all critical factual points are addressed and avoid strategic missteps or forgotten questions.'",

He states that when the judge asked why he wouldn't kill the person, the knife-thrower replied, 'These are not my hands, they are the hands of an artist.' He explained that many times he tried to throw the knife to a different spot, but it 'doesn't go there, it goes where it ought to go.' The lawyer concludes, 'So, I told the judge, I said, here is the man we are wanting to see that he's an accused who's done this trick thousands of times. He knows the scientific basis is this. The error is of a different nature. So, that persuaded the court.' This implies that the 'error' is not a simple mistake, but an intentional act. If the knife went off course, it wasn't because he was careless or bad at his job; it would have been a deliberate choice. This shifted the narrative from an accidental injury to a potential act of violence, which is why it persuaded the court.",
