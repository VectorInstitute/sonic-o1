The video consistently showcases this design principle. Numerous scenes feature large floor-to-ceiling windows and expansive glass doors in the living room, bedrooms, and kitchen, all designed to frame the sea view. Furthermore, the house boasts multiple terraces and balconies, some with furniture, directly overlooking the harbor, which serves as an extension of the indoor living space to the outdoors. This seamless integration of indoor and outdoor spaces through vast openings is the most prominent design feature that connects the luxurious interiors to the location.",
