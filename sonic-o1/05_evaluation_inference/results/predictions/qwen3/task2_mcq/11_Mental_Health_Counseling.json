He explains that the Yijing was used to 'establish what are the many different possibilities that could end up happening' so one could live harmoniously. He then cites Stephen Hawking, stating that quantum mechanics 'predicts a number of different possible outcomes and tells us how likely each of these is.' Finally, he discusses the Huangdi Neijing's advice to 'regulate oneself' and 'adjust our lifestyle based on the four seasons.' This shows a shared philosophy: rather than predicting a single, definite outcome, the best approach is to understand the various possibilities and probabilities, and adapt one's life accordingly to maintain balance and health. This aligns perfectly with option (A). The other options are incorrect because (B) is not supported by the speaker's direct comparison; (C) is too narrow and not supported; (D) is contradicted by the speaker's description of quantum mechanics and the Yijing; and (E) is false as the video provides clear evidence.",

I don't know what certain things mean to certain people.' She emphasizes keeping her room 'as general as possible.' Later, she recounts how drama therapists asked to 'strip the room' to remove pictures, so 'people have nothing to project their fantasies into.' This shows that both Jacci and the therapists share the goal of removing objects that could act as triggers or be used for projection, creating a neutral space. While both mention the concept of minimizing distractions, the core of their reasoning, as stated in the video, is about avoiding triggers and projection.",
