In the top half, a man in a suit, acting as a trainer or coach, holds up a pen and instructs a young woman in the bottom half to sell it to him. The woman begins by describing the pen's features, calling it 'fantastic' and 'smoothly written.' The man immediately stops her, challenging her to explain the specific need it fulfills for a customer rather than just its product attributes. He then takes over, delivering a direct sales lesson. He emphasizes that a salesperson's role is not to simply carry a product but to identify and sell the solution that meets a customer's underlying need. He explains that this 'need' could be for a specific color, thick writing, or to match a costly outfit, and that the salesperson must uncover this before proposing the product. He concludes by praising the woman for asking the right question and reiterating that understanding the need is paramount.",

He then guides her to reframe her approach by asking the crucial question, 'Why do you need this pen?' This simple shift in perspective is the core of the lesson. The emotional dynamic is one of supportive correction; the instructor's feedback is constructive, aimed at helping the trainee understand that true sales are about selling a solution to a customer's problem, not just the product itself. He encourages her to consider the 'need'\u2014whether it's for thick writing, a specific color to match an outfit, or the status of a 'costly pen.'
