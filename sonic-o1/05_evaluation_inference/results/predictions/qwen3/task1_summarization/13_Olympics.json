        "summary_detailed": "The video captures a thrilling moment from a women's speed skating race at the Gangwon 2024 Youth Olympic Games. The skaters, in full racing gear, are initially spread out on the oval ice rink. As the race progresses, a skater in a distinctive red and black suit executes a remarkable strategy by accelerating early and passing the main pack to take a commanding lead. The commentator notes her exceptional move. With only a few laps remaining, the skaters' positions shift dramatically. The skater who took the early lead maintains her composure, while the two skaters from China, who were initially in the lead, begin to slow down as they mistakenly believe the race is over. The commentator explains that they thought their final lap had begun, causing them to stop skating prematurely. However, the skater in red, having realized the error, continues her powerful sprint to the finish line, ultimately winning the race. Her victory is confirmed by her crossing the line first, followed by the other two skaters who resume skating to complete the race. The video concludes with the victorious skater celebrating, and the two Chinese skaters sharing a friendly high-five, acknowledging her skill and the unexpected turn of events.",
