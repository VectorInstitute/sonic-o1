She then states that when a student who has 'seen me before' is placed with a teacher who has a 'poker face,' they will have a 'feeling of dissatisfaction.' This dissatisfaction is not because of something specific that happened, but because the student's prior positive experience with the owner sets an expectation for the entire staff to be energetic and positive. The mismatch between this expectation and the teacher's demeanor is the source of the problem.",
